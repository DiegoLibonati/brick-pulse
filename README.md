# BrickPulse

## Educational Purpose

This project was created primarily for **educational and learning purposes**.  
While it is well-structured and could technically be used in production, it is **not intended for commercialization**.  
The main goal is to explore and demonstrate best practices, patterns, and technologies in software development.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project folder
3. Execute: `npm install`
4. Execute: `npm run dev`

The application will open automatically at `http://localhost:3000`

## Description

**BrickPulse** is a browser-based implementation of the classic Breakout arcade game, built entirely with vanilla TypeScript and no production dependencies. The player controls a horizontal paddle at the bottom of the game board using the left and right arrow keys. A ball bounces continuously across the board, and the objective is to use the paddle to keep the ball in play while it collides with and destroys a grid of 18 blocks arranged in three rows at the top of the board.

Each block destroyed adds one point to the score. The game ends in a win when all blocks have been cleared from the board, or in a loss when the ball falls past the paddle and reaches the bottom edge. The final score is displayed at the end of each match.

The project is structured around a three-layer architecture: pure game logic classes in the core layer (ball physics, block geometry, paddle movement), stateless DOM factory functions in the component layer, and a single page that orchestrates the game loop, collision detection, scoring, and keyboard input. The game loop runs at a fixed interval of 10ms, providing smooth and consistent movement regardless of frame rate.

The codebase follows strict TypeScript configuration with full type safety, and is covered by a suite of unit and integration tests using Jest and Testing Library, ensuring correctness of game mechanics, rendering, user interaction, and cleanup behavior.
